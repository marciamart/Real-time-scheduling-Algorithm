# Real-Time Scheduling: Rate Monotonic (RM) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF)

## Introduction
Real-time scheduling algorithms like **Rate Monotonic (RM)** and **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** are used to manage task execution in systems with strict time constraints. These algorithms ensure tasks meet their deadlines, a critical aspect for real-time applications.

## Rate Monotonic (RM) Scheduling
- **Fixed Priority**: Tasks with shorter periods have higher priority.
- **Preemptive**: Higher priority tasks can interrupt lower priority ones.
- **Utilization Bound**: Can schedule tasks if CPU utilization is â‰¤ 69.3%.
- **Use Case**: Best suited for systems with periodic tasks and moderate CPU utilization.

## Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Scheduling
- **Dynamic Priority**: Tasks with the closest deadline have the highest priority.
- **Preemptive**: Tasks with earlier deadlines can preempt ongoing tasks.
- **Optimal**: Can fully utilize CPU (up to 100%).
- **Use Case**: Ideal for systems with high CPU utilization and both periodic and aperiodic tasks.

## Comparison

| Feature             | Rate Monotonic (RM)         | Earliest Deadline First (EDF)  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Priority**         | Fixed                       | Dynamic                        |
| **Utilization Bound**| 69.3%                       | 100%                           |
| **Complexity**       | Simple                      | More complex                   |

## Conclusion
RM offers simplicity but lower CPU utilization, while EDF is more complex but optimal for high-performance systems. The choice depends on system requirements and resource needs.
